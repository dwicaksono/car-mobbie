## Features

- **Filtering Options:** Users can conveniently filter cars by brand, fuel type, and manufacturing year.
- **API Integration:** The website utilizes a free API from [API Ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com/api/cars) to fetch car data. The endpoint for API requests is `https://api.api-ninjas.com/v1`.
- **Static Images:** All car images are static due to the limitations of the API response, ensuring a consistent user experience.
- **Detailed Information:** Users can view specific details about car features such as fuel type, Front-Wheel Drive (FWD), etc., via popup modals.
- **Technology Stack:** The website is built using Next.js for efficient rendering, Redux Toolkit for state management, Axios for API requests, storybook, and Tailwind CSS for responsive and stylish designs.
