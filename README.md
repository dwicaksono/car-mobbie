# Cars Mobbie Website

Cars Mobbie is a dynamic website dedicated to car enthusiasts, providing detailed information about various cars. Users can filter cars based on their brand, fuel type, and manufacturing year, making it easy to find the perfect match for their preferences.

## Features

- **Filtering Options:** Users can conveniently filter cars by brand, fuel type, and manufacturing year.

- **Static Images:** All car images are static due to the limitations of the API response, ensuring a consistent user experience.
- **Detailed Information:** Users can view specific details about car features such as fuel type, Front-Wheel Drive (FWD), etc., via popup modals.
- **Technology Stack:** The website is built using Next.js for efficient rendering, Redux Toolkit for state management, Axios for API requests, and Tailwind CSS for responsive and stylish designs.
